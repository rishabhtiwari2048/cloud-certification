## Store application data with Azure Blob Storage
    Blobs give you file storage in the cloud and an API that lets you build apps to access the data.

    Blobs are "files for the cloud". Apps work with blobs in much the same way as they would work with files on a disk, like
    reading and writing data. However, unlike a local file, blobs can be reached from anywhere with an internet connection.

    Blobs are stored in containers which are created in Storage Account.

    Blobs and containers support metadata in the form of name-value string pairs. Your apps can use metadata for anything you like:
    a human-readable description of a blob's contents to be displayed by the application, a string that your app uses to determine how to process the blob's data, etc.
