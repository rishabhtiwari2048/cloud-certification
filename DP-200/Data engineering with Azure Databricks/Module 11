# Describe Azure Databricks Delta Lake Architecture

  Describe Bronze, Silver and Gold Architecture
    This module introduces using Delta Lakes as an optimization layer on top of blob storage to ensure reliability, ACID compliance and low latency within unified Streaming + Batch data pipelines.

  Lambda Architecture
    The lambda architecture is a big data processing architecture that addresses this problem by combining both batch- and real-time processing methods. It features an append-only immutable data source that serves as system of record. Timestamped events are appended to existing events (nothing is overwritten). Data is implicitly ordered by time of arrival.

  Delta Lake Architecture
    The Delta Lake Architecture is a vast improvement upon the traditional Lambda architecture. At each stage, we enrich our data through a unified pipeline that allows us to combine batch and streaming workflows through a shared filestore with ACID-compliant transactions.

    Bronze tables contain raw data ingested from various sources (JSON files, RDBMS data, IoT data, etc.)

    Silver tables will provide a more refined view of our data. We can join fields from various bronze tables to enrich streaming records, or update account statuses based on recent activity.

    Gold tables provide business level aggregates often used for reporting and dashboarding. This would include aggregations such as daily active website users, weekly sales per store, or gross revenue per quarter by department.
