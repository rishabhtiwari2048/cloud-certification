#Describe Azure Databricks best practices

1) Workspace Administration

  Understand Workspace administrations best practices

  Map workspaces to business divisions

  Deploy workspaces to multiple subscriptions to honor Azure Databricks Capacity limits

  Databricks Workspace limits
   Key workspace limits are:

    The maximum number of jobs that a workspace can create in an hour is 1000
    At any time, you cannot have more than 150 jobs simultaneously running in a workspace
    There can be a maximum of 150 notebooks or execution contexts attached to a cluster
    There can be a maximum of 1500 Azure Databricks API calls/hour

 Azure Subscription limits
 Next, there are Azure limits to consider since ADB deployments are built on top of the Azure infrastructure.

 Key Azure limits are:

    Storage accounts per region per subscription: 250
    Maximum egress for general-purpose v2 and Blob storage accounts (all regions): 50 Gbps
    Virtual Machines (VMs) per subscription per region: 25,000
    Resource groups per subscription: 980
    These limits are at this point in time and might change going forward. Some of them can also be increased if needed. For more help in understanding the impact of these limits or options of increasing them, please contact Microsoft or Databricks technical architects.

List security best practices
  Consider isolating each workspace in its own VNet
  Do not store any production data in Default Databricks Filesystem (DBFS) Folders
  Always hide secrets in a key vault
  Access control - Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) passthrough
  Configure audit logs and resource utilization metrics to monitor activity
  Querying VM metrics in Log Analytics once you have started the collection using the above document

Describe tools and integration best practices
  Favor cluster scoped init scripts over global and named scripts
  Use cluster log delivery feature to manage logs

Explain Databricks runtime best practices
 Tune shuffle for optimal performance
 Partition your data
