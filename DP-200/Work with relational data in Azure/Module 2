# Migrate your relational data stored in SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.

Azure Database Migration Service automates the task of migrating your databases
to the Azure SQL Database service.

There are following steps involved in a database migration project
1) Pre-migration
  a) Discovery - Identify all objects that rely on existing databases that will
                 be migrated
  b) Assessment - Check for the incompatibilities between your on premise SQL Server
                 and Azure SQL database. Data Migration Assistant (DMA) helps in this
                 case.
  c) Convert - Prepare and deploy scripts to remove incompatibilities between your source
               and target database.

2) Migration
   Use Azure Database Migration Service to migrate your schema data to Azure SQL database.
   Now, Azure Database Migration Service can do it in two modes
    a) Online - Your bulk of the data will be moved while your database is still in use. After this phase
                data will be synced and application can move to Azure SQL database.
    b) Offline - No more changes can be made in your source database once migration starts.
                 Data is migrated and then your application will start using Azure SQL database.

    If you choose Online mode then in that case you have two additional steps,
    a) Sync - any changes made to the data in the source system after the migration are brought into the target database.
    b) Cutover -  source database is taken offline and the new Azure SQL database becomes available.

c) Post-migration
    a) Check the source and target data
    b) Run performance testing and validate if everything is working as expected

Tools involved in the data migration,
  1) Azure Database Migration Service -It runs on Azure Platform as opposed to being a client application like Azure Data Migration Assistant.
  2) Data Migration Assistant - Its a client side tool can be hosted on Windows Compatible Workstation or Server.

Steps to migrate a database from SQL Server running on an Azure Virtual Machine in Cloud to Azure SQL Database.

Step 1) Connect to Azure Virtual Machine running SQL Server using RDP from your system

Step 2) Disable IE Enhanced Security Configuration for Administrator in Local Server

Step 3) Download install and run Data Migration Assistant on Virtual Machine

Step 4) Create a new project in Azure Database Migration Ser and connect to SQL Server instance running on virtual Machine

Step 5) Run checks for database incompatibilities and feature incompatibilities.

Step 6) Resolve the incompatibilities before moving ahead

Once all the incompatibilities are resolved, we are ready for migration. We can do migration in two modes

1) Offline - In offline migration, source database on SQL Server instance is unavailable for the entire duration
             of migration activity.
2) Online - In online migration, source database on SQL Server is only unavailable during sync activity after the
most of data has been migrated in the Azure SQL database. In the first part of online migration, migration Service
takes the backup of source database and migrates it to the destination. After this source database is taken Offline
and service syncs target with source using transaction log of the source database.
This type of migration does the job with minimal downtime but its costly compared to offline migration.

Step 7) Now for migration, in Virtual Machine open ADMS and create a migration type project. Choose schema only in Migration Scope.

        a) Select source database
        b) Select target Server
        c) Select target database
        d) Select database objects which you want to move
        e) Click on Generate SQL Script
        f) Click on deploy schema

# Migrate a database with downtime by using Azure Database Migration Service
Step 8) Provision azure database migration service in the same region where source database is located
        a) Create a migration project
        b) Provide source login credentials (SQL Server)
        c) Provide destination login credentials (Azure SQL Database)
        d) Set Source DB Read-Only and make sure you are not logged in to database anywhere else
           otherwise migration will fail.
        e) Select list of objects which you want to migrate
        f) Run migration and after migration is successful connect to Azure SQL Database and check the data
