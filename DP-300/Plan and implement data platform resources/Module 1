Deploy SQL Server in a Virtual Machine

This module will focus on ways to provision and deploy Microsoft SQL Server into an Azure virtual machine. It will also provide concrete information on the various options when you are performing a migration.

Explain IaaS options for Deploying SQL Server in Azure

  SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension
  Extensions are code that is executed on your VM post-deployment, typically to perform post deployment configurations. Some examples are installing anti-virus features, or installing a Windows feature. The SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension provides three key features that can reduce your administrative overhead.

      SQL Server automated backup
      SQL Server automated patching
      Azure Key Vault integration

  SQL Server licensing models
      Microsoft Software Assurance Program
      Pay per minute model
      Bring Your Own License (BYOL)
      Azure Hybrid Use Benefit (AHUB)

  Virtual Machine Families
      General Purpose : a balanced ration of CPU to memory.
      Compute Optimized : Compute optimized VMs have a high CPU-to-memory ratio
      Memory Optimized : These VMs provide high memory-to-CPU ratio. Well suited for most database workloads
      Storage Optimized : Storage optimized VMs provide fast, local, NVMe storage that is ephemeral
      GPU : Azure VMs with GPUs are targeted at two main types of workloadsâ€”naturally graphics processing operations like video rendering and processing, but also massively parallel machine learning workloads that can take advantage of GPUs.
      High Performance Compute : High Performance Compute workloads support applications that can scale horizontally to thousands of CPU cores.
