  Describe recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO)

    Recovery time objective : Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum amount of time available to bring resources online after an outage or problem. If that process takes longer than the RTO, there could be consequences such as financial penalties, work not able to be done, and so on. RTO can be specified for the whole solution, which includes all resources, as well as for individual components such as SQL Server instances and databases.

    Recovery point objective : Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the point in time to which a database should be recovered and equates to the maximum amount of data loss that the business is willing to accept.
